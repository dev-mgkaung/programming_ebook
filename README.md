# Programming Ebook (Flutter Project)

Programming Ebook Collections Application (Bloc Pattern)

Are You looking  for production level or large project or bloc pattern sample code? 
Sure , this is best practice source code for flutter beginner. (Project structure is simply and easy to maintain)
I suggest for you . You need to learn Bloc pattern.
Sorry My english is not good.Let me say this project is not complete . I always add new code , new feature by daily to complete project.

Project Structure
--------

     * lib
         * models        ( for collection of data)
         * constraints   ( for common data values)
         * services      ( for network or local database repositories)
         * widgets       ( for common widget eg. validators, customwidget..)
         * utils         (for other logic functions)
         * screens       ( Each Page)
         * home > blocs, local_widget, home_screen.dart (like that)
         * assets        ( Resource folder for image, svg, logo )
         * resources     ( Resource file for language eg. eng.json, my.json, ch.json)
         
      * app.dart    ( root widget is MaterialApp or CapitinoApp , theme, locate,..)
      * main.dart   ( App Launch main widget)
      * routes.dart ( Navigtion Page management System)
  
  
 ** Basic Logic
 
    If you know android knowledge , we define Activity is Page and Fragment is Screen.
    eg. Our app have two page. Login Page and Home Page. So. Navigator route system pass form LoginPage to HomePage.
      HomePage have four Screen .(like fragment HomeFragment,NotificationFragment...and so on)
      ## Note that this rule only for my project structure. I dont know other people how to define for it.
